# life
Simulate single cell organisms living, eating, dying, and reproducing in a small virtual space.

## Rules
- The game starts with 6 live cells randomly distributed.
- Each turn, each live cell will eat a random cell that is still a nutrient and move there, leaving behind an empty location.
- If another live cell is near, a new cell will be born in the vicinity.
- If a live cell cannot eat, it does and becomes nutrient.
